# Chat_with_documents

## Project Title: Chat with PDF using Gemini 💬📄

### Project Overview
This project allows you to interact with a PDF document using an AI-powered conversational interface. By uploading your PDF, you can ask questions, and the model will extract the information from the document to provide relevant answers.

This is built using **Streamlit**, **LangChain**, **Google Generative AI**, and **Sentence Transformers**.

### Key Features:
- Upload multiple PDF files.
- Automatically extracts and splits text from PDF into chunks.
- Uses embedding models to process the text.
- Allows users to ask questions and get answers based on the content of the PDF.

## Technologies Used 💻🔧
- **Python 3.x** – Programming language
- **Streamlit** – Framework for creating the web interface
- **LangChain** – For chaining language model operations
- **Google Generative AI** – For using embeddings and language models
- **Sentence-Transformers** – For text embeddings
- **FAISS** – For storing and querying embeddings efficiently
- **PyPDF2** – For reading and extracting text from PDF files

## How to Use the Chatbot 💬

1. **Upload your PDF**: In the sidebar, click on "Upload your PDF Files". Select one or multiple PDF files to upload.

2. **Process the PDFs**: Click the **"Submit & Process"** button. The text from the PDF will be extracted and indexed.

3. **Ask Questions**: Once processing is done, type a question in the input box. The model will respond based on the content of your uploaded PDF.

### Example:
- **Question**: "What is the main topic of the document?"
- **Answer**: The model will provide the best possible answer by processing the text in the document.
